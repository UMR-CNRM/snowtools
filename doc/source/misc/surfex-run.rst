Run a SURFEX-Crocus simulation
==============================

 Running a SURFEX-Crocus simulation is done with the ``s2m`` command installed with ``snowtools`` python package. Please run ``s2m research --help`` for more details.

 Note that some functions may only be available on supercomputers through the Meteo-France internal vortex toolbox. These functions are clearly identified in the help.
