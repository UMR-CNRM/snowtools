Forest masks were made by Matthieu Baron from the forest dataset of IGN `BD Foret V2 <https://geoservices.ign.fr/bdforet>`_.
The code and a note [#f2]_ to reproduce the masks can be found in his git depot [#f3]_.

To simplify, the BD foret dataset present polygones of different vegetation cover. Different vegetation types are selected. Vegetation formation of "landes" and "formation herbac√©es" are removed. The
The polygones are then rasterized to the simulation grid.


RGI Glacier Masks

The glaciers mask is simply from a rasterisation of the `RGI glacier inventory <https://www.glims.org/RGI/>`_ to the simulation grid.

Lake, rivers and cities masks are hand picked from IGN shapefile `BD TOPO <https://geoservices.ign.fr/documentation/donnees/vecteur/bdtopo>`_.
Lakes and rivers are taken form the hydrographic shapefiles, cities from the "commune" shapefile.


Geomorphons Masks
*****************

Geomorphons detection are methods for classification and mapping of landform elements from a DEM based on the principle of pattern recognition rather than differential geometry. [#f1]_

I used a dedicated software to perform this analysis, `Whitebox Tools <https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/>`_, producing the pixel classification .
The geomorphons concept is based on line-of-sight analysis for the eight topographic profiles in the cardinal directions surrounding each grid cell in the input DEM.

I used the command line interface of the whitebox_tools software (see website to install) with the *-r=Geomorphons* option. This command take as input a DEM (need to be on the same grid as the simulation),
the DEM zone must be larger than the zone of interest because we are using a search radius to detect the different landform feature. I chose a search radius of 2.5 km (100 pixel at 250m resolution). The larger the search radius is, the less dependant to resolution the classification is.
I also choose a flat threshold of 1 degree. Finally the output is presented for the 10 most common landforms as in [#f1]_.

Full command documentation : https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbt_book/available_tools/geomorphometric_analysis.html#geomorphons

Example of command::

  ./whitebox_tools -r=Geomorphons -v --wd=. --dem=DEM_FRANCE_L93_250m_bilinear.tif -o=output_100_r.tif --residuals --search=100 --threshold=1 --forms

Then to convert the geomorphon tif to netcdf (to be used as input by snowtools), you can use `gdal_translate <https://gdal.org/programs/gdal_translate.html>`_ ::

  gdal_translate -of NetCDF <input_filename> <output_filename>
