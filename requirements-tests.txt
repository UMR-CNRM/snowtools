#
# To install python package, it is recommanded to installl the system package with:
# sudo apt install python3-gdal
#
# However, if you want to install it in a virtual environment, you can install gdal python package, once
# requirements fulfilled with the following command line:
# pip install GDAL==$(gdal-config --version) --global-option=build_ext --global-option="$(gdal-config --cflags)"
#
# Note that older versions of GDAL package
# (e.g. version currently obtained with previously cited packages of Ubuntu 20.04LTS)
# requires to have a version of setuptools<58.0.0
#
# Due to all these limitations, GDAL is not listed here as a requirement.
