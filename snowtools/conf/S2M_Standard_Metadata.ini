comment = These data are provided on a semi-distributed grid based on relatively homogeneous areas
          called massifs where the variability of meteorological and snow conditions are assumed
          to depend only on elevation, aspect and slope. A metadata shapefile is associated with
          these data to describe the massif names and contours.

summary = This file takes part from a 61-years reanalysis of meteorological and snow conditions in the
                        French Alps, Pyrenees and Corsica from 1958 to 2020. The simulations are performed over
                        relatively homogeneous units designed to represent the main drivers of the spatial
                        variability observed in mountain ranges (elevation, slope and aspect). The meteorological
                        reanalysis is performed by the SAFRAN system, which adjusts a guess from a Numerical Weather
                        Prediction model (ERA-40 reanalysis from 1958 to 2002, ARPEGE from 2002 to 2018) with the
                        best possible set of available in-situ meteorological observations. SAFRAN outputs are used
                        to force the Crocus detailed snowpack model within the land surface scheme SURFEX/ISBA.
                        This provides the evolution of the snowpack and the associated avalanche hazard accounting
                        for the main physical processes involved in a multilayer snowpack.

title = S2M operational chain
summary = This file takes part from the operational modelling chain of meteorological and snow conditions
                        in the French Alps, Pyrenees and Corsica. The simulations are performed over relatively
                        homogeneous units designed to represent the main drivers of the spatial variability observed
                        in mountain ranges (elevation, slope and aspect). The meteorological analysis and forecast
                        is produced by the SAFRAN system, which adjusts a guess from a Numerical Weather Prediction
                        model (ARPEGE or PEARP) with the best possible set of available in-situ meteorological
                        observations. SAFRAN outputs are used to force the Crocus detailed snowpack model within
                        the land surface scheme SURFEX/ISBA. This provides the evolution of the snowpack and the
