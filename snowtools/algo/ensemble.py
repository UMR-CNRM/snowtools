        Main method, the first that is executed at the initialization of the

        Its purpose is to set the worker's specific sub-environment (move to
        the potential corresponding sub-directory) and to return the output
        state of the worker (stored in the `rdict` dictionary) to the main Algo
        Component.

        such a dictionary storing potential execution errors (in the `rc` entry
        of the dictionary). As a consequence, any part of code within the worker
        that might raise a python Exception must be encapsulated in a
        try/except instruction in order to catch such exception, put it into
        the `rdict` output and return it to the main Algo Component where all
        exceptions should be managed properly.

        :note: Any un-catched exception will cause a (clean) shutdown of the
               :mod:`taylorism` system (e.g. All the other workers will be killed
